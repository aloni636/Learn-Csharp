# Test Subjects for My Experiments

This is where I learn about C#, C++ and interop between them.

The solution structure is as follows:
* **Basics** - Learning about C# & C++ langauge features
* **PInvokeInterop** - Learning about C# & C++ interop using low level C ABI platform invoke
* **CppCliInterop** - Connecting basic C# and C++ using Microsoft's CPP/CLI interop layer
